    <div class="important-notice">
      <strong>Important Notice</strong>
      UK Legal Docs provides document templates for informational purposes only. The documents generated by our Service do not constitute legal advice and should not be treated as such. We strongly recommend having any legal documents reviewed by a qualified solicitor before use.
    </div>

    <h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
    <p>By accessing or using the UK Legal Docs website and document generation service (the "Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use the Service.</p>
    <p>These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you and UK Legal Docs ("we", "us", or "our").</p>

    <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>UK Legal Docs provides an online tool that generates template legal documents, including Privacy Policies, Terms of Service, and Cookie Policies, based on information you provide through our questionnaire.</p>
    <p>The Service is designed to help UK businesses create basic legal document templates. The documents are generated using standardised templates and the specific information you input about your business.</p>

    <h2>3. Not Legal Advice</h2>
    <p><strong>The documents and information provided through this Service do not constitute legal advice and are not a substitute for advice from a qualified legal professional.</strong></p>
    <p>By using our Service, you acknowledge and agree that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>UK Legal Docs is not a law firm and does not provide legal advice.</li>
      <li>No solicitor-client relationship is created between you and UK Legal Docs.</li>
      <li>The generated documents are templates designed for general use and may not address all legal requirements specific to your business, industry, or circumstances.</li>
      <li>Laws and regulations change frequently, and while we endeavour to keep our templates current, we cannot guarantee they reflect the most recent legal requirements at any given time.</li>
      <li>You are solely responsible for ensuring that any documents you use comply with all applicable laws and regulations.</li>
      <li>We strongly recommend that you have all generated documents reviewed by a qualified solicitor before implementing them in your business.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. User Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>When using our Service, you agree to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide accurate and complete information about your business when completing our questionnaire.</li>
      <li>Review the generated documents carefully before use.</li>
      <li>Seek independent legal advice if you are unsure whether the documents are suitable for your specific circumstances.</li>
      <li>Keep your legal documents up to date as your business practices or applicable laws change.</li>
      <li>Not rely solely on the generated documents without understanding their content and implications.</li>
      <li>Use the Service only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The Service, including all content, features, and functionality, is owned by UK Legal Docs and is protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws.</p>
    <p>Upon purchase, you are granted a non-exclusive, non-transferable licence to use the generated documents for your own business purposes. You may not:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Resell, redistribute, or commercially exploit the document templates.</li>
      <li>Create derivative services or products based on our templates.</li>
      <li>Remove any proprietary notices from the documents.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Payment and Refunds</h2>
    <p>Payment is required to access and download the generated documents. All prices are displayed in GBP and include VAT where applicable.</p>
    <p>Due to the nature of digital products that are immediately accessible upon purchase, refunds are generally not available once documents have been generated and downloaded. However, we will consider refund requests on a case-by-case basis if there are genuine technical issues with the Service.</p>

    <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p><strong>To the fullest extent permitted by law:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>UK Legal Docs, its directors, employees, and agents shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the Service or the documents generated.</li>
      <li>This includes, without limitation, any damages arising from legal disputes, regulatory fines, enforcement actions, or any other consequences resulting from your use of the generated documents.</li>
      <li>Our total liability to you for any claims arising from or related to the Service shall not exceed the amount you paid for the Service.</li>
      <li>We are not liable for any losses arising from your failure to seek independent legal advice.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits our liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence, fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation, or any other liability that cannot be excluded or limited by English law.</p>

    <h2>8. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>The Service and generated documents are provided "as is" and "as available" without any warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.</li>
      <li>Any warranty that the documents will meet your specific legal requirements.</li>
      <li>Any warranty that the documents will be error-free, complete, or current.</li>
      <li>Any warranty that use of the documents will protect you from legal liability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless UK Legal Docs, its directors, officers, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from or related to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your use of the Service or the generated documents.</li>
      <li>Your breach of these Terms.</li>
      <li>Any third-party claims arising from your use of the generated documents.</li>
      <li>Any regulatory or legal action taken against you in relation to documents generated through our Service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10. Modifications to Service and Terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Service at any time without notice. We may also update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the Service after any changes constitutes acceptance of the modified Terms.</p>

    <h2>11. Termination</h2>
    <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the Service immediately, without prior notice, for any reason, including if you breach these Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the Service will cease immediately.</p>

    <h2>12. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales. Any disputes arising from or relating to these Terms or your use of the Service shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.</p>

    <h2>13. Severability</h2>
    <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.</p>

    <h2>14. Entire Agreement</h2>
    <p>These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and UK Legal Docs regarding the Service and supersede all prior agreements and understandings.</p>
