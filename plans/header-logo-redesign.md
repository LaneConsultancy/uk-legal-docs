# Header & Logo Redesign Plan

**Status: COMPLETE**

## Problem
- Current logo has a white background that clashes with the navy header
- Logo icon is too small and hard to see
- Overall header looks unprofessional

## Solution

### 1. Generate New Logo
- Create a larger, more impressive logo design
- Make it bolder and more visible at small sizes
- Use the navy (#1e3a5f) and gold (#c9a227) colour scheme
- Design should work well at 44-50px display size

### 2. Remove Background
- Use the `remove-background` skill to strip the white background
- Ensure transparency works on the navy header

### 3. Update Header CSS
- Increase logo icon size for better visibility
- Adjust spacing if needed
- Ensure the logo displays crisply

## Files to Modify
- `logo.png` - Replace with new transparent logo
- `index.html` - Adjust `.logo-icon` CSS if needed

## Success Criteria
- Logo is clearly visible against navy background
- No white box around the logo
- Professional, trustworthy appearance
- Works well at both desktop and mobile sizes
